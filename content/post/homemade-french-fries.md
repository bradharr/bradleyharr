One of my favorite foods is potatoes. Any style, any way you want to make them. I could eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love potatoes! However, given their starch and carb count, I have to be careful how many I eat, especially at one time. Too many potatoes in a single sitting and I won’t be “sitting” long. I’ll be passed out somewhere in a sugar coma!  

With all of that being said, I still can’t resist sometimes indulging in some of these amazing homemade French Fries! I came across this recipe on YouTube. The recipe comes from the YouTube Channel by “Fabulessly Frugal”. I will embed the video at the bottom of the post for those would would prefer to watch the recipe being made. All I can tell you is that I followed her recipe, making mine in my Ninja Foodi on the Air Crisp setting, and they have turned out perfect every time! Crispy on the outside and soft, tasty potato on the inside. They have become a favorite in our household and are often requested by my family. Now for the recipe!  

## Recipe
Prep Time: 15 Min
Total Time: 35 Min
Serves: 3-4  

### Ingredients  
* 2 or 3 Large Baking Potatoes
* 2 Tbsp Avocado or Olive Oil
* Seasoning Salt to Taste  

### Instructions
1. Rinse and dry the potatoes.
2. On a cutting board, slice the potatoes lengthwise about a finger-width between each slice.
3. Lay each slice flat and slice again, lengthwise about a finger-width between each slice. You should now have French Fry shaped slices. Note: You can slice any size you would like, but it’s important for the slices to be similar in size so they all cook evenly.
4. Place all the fries into a large bowl and fill until the fries are covered with cold water to start rinsing the starch from the potatoes. Pour out the water.
5. Repeat step 4 two more times or until the water is clear and not cloudy.
6. Fill the bowl one last time with warm water until the fries are covered and leave soaking for 10 minutes. Pour out the water.
7. This step is important. Dry each fry with a clean towel or paper towels. This will help them to cook if they are dry and not wet.
8. Dry out the bowl used to soak the fries in water and add the fries back to the bowl.
9. Add 1 Tbsp of oil to the fries and toss to cover.
10. Place the fries in your Air Fryer and cook for 5-10 min on 350 or until the fries start to turn from white to a glossy yellow color.
11. Take the fries out of the Air Fryer and place them back into the bowl and add another 1 Tbsp of oil as well as your Seasoning Salt (or your favorite French Fry seasoning) to taste and toss to coat.
12. Place the fries back into the Air Fryer and cook on 400 for 20 min, turning fries with a pair of tongs every 5 min until done.
