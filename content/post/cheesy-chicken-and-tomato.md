One day recently I was shamefully scrolling mindlessly through Facebook, as we all sometimes do. Don’t lie, you know you do it. Anyway, I came across one of those short videos that shows you how to make a dinner recipe idea and this one looked delicious so I thought, what the heck, let’s give it a go. It’s a very simple dish comprised of chicken, a glaze, cheese, and tomato. Very simple, quick, and easy to make. It has become one of our favorite chicken dishes for dinner in our house. Let’s get to it…  

## Recipe
Prep Time: 10 Min
Total Time: 30 Min
Serves: 4  

### Ingredients
* 4 Chicken Breasts or 8 – 9 Chicken Tenders
* 4 Tbsp Olive Oil
* 1 tsp Paprika
* 1 tsp Black Pepper
* 2 tsp Salt
* 2 tsp Oregano
* Mozzarella or White Cheddar Cheese Cubes (Sliced Thin, 1 x 1 in square)
* Cherry Tomatoes (Sliced in half)  

### Instructions
1. Grease a baking dish with Pam or oil
2. Prepare Chicken by making a few slices that go about halfway down into the chicken breast, about 1 inch apart
3. Prepare glaze by combining Olive Oil, Paprika, Black Pepper, Salt, and Oregano in a bowl
4. Brush glaze all over chicken and down into the slices you made previously
5. Take cheese cubes and stand up one cheese cube into each slice you made in the chicken
6. Take cherry tomato halves and lay them between each piece of cheese and one on each end of the chicken to hold the cheese cubes upright and in place
7. Preheat oven to 390 and bake for 40 Minutes or until your chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit
